Karma is the test runner 
	- spawn browsers run jasmine in side them from cli 
	- rerun test with changes
	- enables to rerun testd from cli , whenever there is a change in source code 
Jasmine is the testing framework used in Angular cli. 
BDD/TDD 
name of the test file should be sys.spec.ts
Commonly used functions are 
	Describe()  --> Suite / group of related tests
	it() --> defines the spec / testing : for each 
	
Defintion 
	
	describe(name of the system under test, function that test runner calls)
	{
		it(testname, function )
		{
			result = function call
			expect(result).tobe(20) --> used for numbers
						.toContain('JOsh') --> used for strings /array 
						.tobefalsy()
						.tobegreaterthan()
						.tobeDefined()
		}
	}
	
	
karma runs as soon as it detects the change in source file.. reruns the tests 
ng test --> launches browser window connected to karma 
debug using chrom developer tools 



Pattern 

 setup & tearDown -> state change of component 
	Structure AAA - Arrnage , Act 
		describe()
		{
			it()
			{
				let component = new component
				component.function()
				expect().tobe()
			}
		}		
	Clean state -> 
		beforeEach() --> re intialize objects 
		{
			let component = new component
		}
		afterEach() {} --> cleanup code 
		beforeAll() --> run once
		afterAll() --> run once
		
Jasmine - only runs test all the files are loaded in browser ie jasmine HTML file 


GRUN/GULP --> CLI to run / execute files 
karma - handle angular cli 
ng test --> tests in our project in Jasmine via Karma.
DISABLE 
You can disable tests without commenting them our by just pre-pending x to the describe or it
